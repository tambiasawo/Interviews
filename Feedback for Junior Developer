Feedback for Junior Developer

1. Display the list of buildings in order of most recently added: This is so that the user does not have to scroll down to see the newly added building

2. Use Optimistic mutate to cause immediate change after user adds or deletes a building: This improves the overall user experience, since the user is not left wondering what is happening after adding/deleting a building

3. Set form input fields as required: Since both form fields are required by the API, they should be set as required

4. Set address input field to type address:
   Since we are dealling with an address, the address field should be set to type address.

5. Make mouse cursor change to a pointer on button hover

6. Replace delete button with icon: This takes up less space and looks better on mobile
